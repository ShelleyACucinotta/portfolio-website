                    As much as I loved my career I knew it was time. Time to grow, to explore,
                    to be challenged.  I have learned over the years to be open. Be open to
                    new possibilities, new people, new adventures and if you don’t like something
                    change it. This is what started my curiosity. The curiosity to see what is
                    out there. I researched, asked questions, and read articles about any career
                    that interested me. Then I found UX Design and I knew that was it.

                  <ul>I truly love the question WHY? might sound like a 4-year asking mom why? why? why? Still,
                      it works, I am fascinated by how much you can learn by that one simple word, why?</ul>

                    Changing careers is a big decision, at first, this seemed like they were very
                    very different and a bit overwhelming. Yet, the more I studied UX Design the
                    more I came to see how much I was already doing this process as a trainer and
                    nutrition coach. The design process has very similar components to training
                    program design.</p>
