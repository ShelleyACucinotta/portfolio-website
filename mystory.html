          <h1>My Story</h1>
          <p>
            As much as I loved my career I knew it was time. Time to grow, to explore,
            to be challenged. I have learned over the years to be open. Be open to
            new possibilities, new people, new adventures and if you don’t like something
            change it. This is what started my curiosity. The curiosity to see what is
            out there. I researched, asked questions, and read articles about any career
            that interested me. Then I found UX Design and I knew that was it.
          </p>
          <h4><strong>What was it that pulled me in?</strong></h4>
          <ul id="my-list">
            <li>I found enjoyment for the entire design process</li>
            <li>I was very intrigued by how much focus is on the user needs</li>
            <li>I am very excited about the team aspect of the design process</li>
            <li>I truly love the question WHY? might sound like a 4-year asking mom why? why? why? Still,
              it works, I am fascinated by how much you can learn by that one simple word, why?</li>
            <li>I love sticky notes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Changing careers is a big decision, at first, this seemed like they were very
            very different and a bit overwhelming. Yet, the more I studied UX Design the
            more I came to see how much I was already doing this process as a trainer and
            nutrition coach. The design process has very similar components to training
            program design.
